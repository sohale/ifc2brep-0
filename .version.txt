v0.1.0 "compiling was working"
     #Â not a tag. Since things are not removed / cleaned-up from it

v0.2.0 "LSP in place too. Is a leaf. Is a tag."  # leaf means it will be subject to cleanup.
     # version leaf/tag
     # for 0.2.0
     # 0.2.0 : "after LSP & build and a minimal content-traversing example is in place and compiling"
     # it is as of development efforts leading to: May 16 2024
     # i.e. "LSP support using clangd (from May 16 2024, 18:00-19:40)"
     # It is ðŸŸ¢ (function, compile, etc)
     # But it is red in terms of cleanliness
     # But it is good in terms of documenting things
     # Undocumented: part: secret: the structure of the secret file
     #Â let's document it in the readme.md
